# DiploMate

## Description
DiploMate is the application I developed as my diploma thesis project.
This web application aims to be a space where professors can upload diploma thesis topics and their details, and students can search for diploma thesis topics. Students can either apply for a topic and the application will add them in a list of candidates or they
can request from the application to offer them an available topic. Professors can
schedule interviews with the students on the list, and grade their outcome, so that they
can choose the right one for the topic. In this space professors and students can be in constant contact about everything related to their cooperation in a
thesis topic, from scheduling meetings and exchanging files, to scheduling and grading
its examination.
